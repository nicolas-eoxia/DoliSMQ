 *
 * Shared engine behind both answering surfaces (public QR page and connected PWA screen).
 * The questions are rendered as one continuous scroll; sections only exist to title the
 * groups, to count progress and to feed the quick jump menu. The answer widgets themselves
 * stay in show_answer_from_question().
 *
 * @param  CommonObject $object            Control or Survey being answered (lines are loaded if needed).
 * @param  array        $questionsAndGroups Ordered Question/QuestionGroup list of the sheet.
 * @return array<int,array{type:string,key:string,label:string,picto:string,description:string,items:array,total:int,answered:int}>
